## Program Description

The task that this project helped with ended, which therefore ended the development of this program.  

This Python program reads a question and four possible answers. Afterwards it outputs whether each option is either right, wrong, or not found and stores any new results. This program helps to weave though imposter answers and allows the user to easily extract questions and their correct answers.
